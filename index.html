                    <p class="paragraph">HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies
                        webpage structure.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        In 1990, as part of his vision of the Web, Tim Berners-Lee defined the concept of hypertext,
                        which Berners-Lee formalized the following year through a markup mainly based on SGML. The IETF
                        began formally specifying HTML in 1993, and after several drafts released version 2.0 in 1995.
                        In 1994 Berners-Lee founded the W3C to develop the Web. In 1996, the W3C took over the HTML work
                        and published the HTML 3.2 recommendation a year later. HTML 4.0 was released in 1999 and became
                        an ISO standard in 2000.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">At that time, the W3C nearly abandoned HTML in favor of XHTML, prompting the
                        founding of an independent group called WHATWG in 2004. Thanks to WHATWG, work on HTML5
                        continued: the two organizations released the first draft in 2008 and the final standard in
                        2014.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">An HTML document is a plaintext document structured with elements. Elements are
                        surrounded by matching opening and closing tags. Each tag begins and ends with angle brackets (
                        <>). There are a few empty or void tags that cannot enclose any text, for instance <img>.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">For Web developers, it is now fairly common to be called upon to create a Web
                        site or app that changes its user interface depending on the browser or device accessing the
                        site to provide an optimized experience. One approach to this is to create different versions of
                        your site/app for different platforms or browsers and serve them appropriately after detecting
                        which browser or platform is looking at your site. But this is increasingly inefficient: browser
                        sniffing is inherently error prone, and maintaining multiple copies of your code can turn out to
                        be a nightmare.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        It is usually much better to create a single version of your code which doesn't care about what
                        browser or platform is accessing the site, but instead uses feature tests to find out what code
                        features the browser supports or what the values of certain browser features are, and then
                        adjusts the code appropriately. This tends to be termed responsive design or adaptive design,
                        two related but different approaches. For a discussion on the differences between the two, read
                        Responsive design versus adaptive design.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        This is much more reliable, more maintainable, and more future proof. You don't get caught in
                        the situation of having to bring out more new site versions as more new browsers and platforms
                        come out, and adjust code as feature support in existing browsers changes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        There are disadvantages to this approach as well. If the content, layout, and functionality need
                        to change greatly for different devices, it may not be such a good approach. Also, taking an
                        existing site and adding responsiveness to it, to make it mobile/tablet friendly, can be a lot
                        more effort than just creating a separate mobile site or app, especially if it is a sprawling
                        enterprise site. Read more about responsive design advantages and disadvantages.

                        JavaScript (JS) is a programming language mostly used to dynamically script webpages on the
                        client side, but it is also often utilized on the server-side, using packages such as Node.js.

                    <p class="paragraph">Conceived as a server-side language by Brendan Eich (then employed by the
                        Netscape Corporation), JavaScript soon came to Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995.
                        JavaScript enjoyed immediate success and Internet Explorer 3.0 introduced JavaScript support
                        under the name JScript in August 1996.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">In November 1996, Netscape began working with ECMA International to make
                        JavaScript an industry standard. Since then, the standardized JavaScript is called ECMAScript
                        and specified under ECMA-262, whose latest (nine, ES2018) edition is available in June 2018.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">JavaScript is mostly used in the browser, enabling developers to manipulate

                        JavaScript is one of the world's most commonly-used languages, owing to the recent growth and

                    <p class="paragraph">A package manager or package-management system is a collection of software
                        tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer
                        programs for a computer's operating system in a consistent manner.[1]</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">A package manager deals with packages, distributions of software and data in
                        archive files. Packages contain metadata, such as the software's name, description of its
                        purpose, version number, vendor, checksum, and a list of dependencies necessary for the software
                        to run properly. Upon installation, metadata is stored in a local package database. Package
                        managers typically maintain a database of software dependencies and version information to
                        prevent software mismatches and missing prerequisites. They work closely with software
                        repositories, binary repository managers, and app stores.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Package managers are designed to eliminate the need for manual installs and
                        updates. This can be particularly useful for large enterprises whose operating systems are based
                        on Linux and other Unix-like systems, typically consisting of hundreds or even tens of thousands
                        of distinct software packages.[2]</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">npm (originally short for Node Package Manager)[3] is a package manager for the
                        JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime
                        environment Node.js. It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online
                        database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry. The registry is
                        accessed via the client, and the available packages can be browsed and searched via the npm
                        website. The package manager and the registry are managed by npm, Inc.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">In computer science, a preprocessor is a program that processes its input data
                        to produce output that is used as input to another program. The output is said to be a
                        preprocessed form of the input data, which is often used by some subsequent programs like
                        compilers. The amount and kind of processing done depends on the nature of the preprocessor;
                        some preprocessors are only capable of performing relatively simple textual substitutions and
                        macro expansions, while others have the power of full-fledged programming languages.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">A common example from computer programming is the processing performed on
                        source code before the next step of compilation. In some computer languages (e.g., C and PL/I)
                        there is a phase of translation known as preprocessing. It can also include macro processing,
                        file inclusion and language extensions.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">A CSS preprocessor is a program that lets you generate CSS from the
                        preprocessor's own unique syntax. There are many CSS preprocessors to choose from, however most
                        CSS preprocessors will add some features that don't exist in pure CSS, such as mixin, nesting
                        selector, inheritance selector, and so on. These features make the CSS structure more readable
                        and easier to maintain.
                        To use a CSS preprocessor, you must install a CSS compiler on your web server.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">In computer programming, a software framework is an abstraction in which
                        software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by additional user-written
                        code, thus providing application-specific software. A software framework provides a standard way
                        to build and deploy applications. A software framework is a universal, reusable software
                        environment that provides particular functionality as part of a larger software platform to
                        facilitate development of software applications, products and solutions. Software frameworks may
                        include support programs, compilers, code libraries, tool sets, and application programming
                        interfaces (APIs) that bring together all the different components to enable development of a
                        project or system.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Frameworks have key distinguishing features that separate them from normal libraries:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>inversion of control: In a framework, unlike in libraries or in standard user applications,
                            the
                            overall program's flow of control is not dictated by the caller, but by the framework.[1]
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            extensibility: A user can extend the framework – usually by selective overriding – or
                            programmers can add specialized user code to provide specific functionality.</li>
                        <li>non-modifiable framework code: The framework code, in general, is not supposed to be
                            modified,
                            while accepting user-implemented extensions. In other words, users can extend the framework,
                            but
                            cannot modify its code.</li>

                        A CSS framework is a software framework that is meant to allow for easier, more
                        standards-compliant web design using the Cascading Style Sheets language. Most of these
                        frameworks contain at least a grid. More functional frameworks also come with more features and
                        additional JavaScript based functions, but are mostly design oriented and unobtrusive. This
                        differentiates these from functional and full JavaScript frameworks.

                    <p class="paragraph">A task runner is exactly what it sounds like, a program that can execute
                        tasks
                        based on specific criteria. Common usages are to set up a task that runs everytime a certain
                        file is changed (or group of files) so you don't have to explicitly recompile every time, or
                        to
                        restart a server every time you restart the database.

                        Gulp.js is used mostly for node/javaScript related tasks and there is a huge library of
                        pre-built tasks that can do all kinds of stuff with your code.</p>

                        because
                        it is a way to increase the code quality. Linting consists of checking a source code for
                        programmatic and stylistic errors. In addition, you are saving time by formatting your

                        framework that allows you to test React components in an easy and quick way. Also, imagine that
                        it brings a coverage code report. And all this without the need to install any extra features.
                        Who wouldn’t want something like this to test their code? Well, let me introduce you to the
                        wonderful framework called Jest.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Jest is a testing framework created by Facebook to test JavaScript code, in
                        particular for React apps. But you must be wondering, why is it a good option to test your app
                        using this framework? Let’s mention some of the incredible benefits Jest has, and that will
                        definitely erase your concerns.

                        Setup – It’s really easy to set up on your JavaScript solution.
                        Configuration – Jest is already configured for “create-react-app” script. Just one command and
                        you are ready to start coding your tests.
                        Works with TypeScript – It works with any JavaScript compiler and also integrates with Babel and
                        typescript.
                        Good performance – Jest has the capability to run tests in parallel.
                        Snapshots – Jest includes a snapshots feature to simplify your tests.
                        Mocking library – Jest provides the ability to mock any function or component.
                        Coverage report – Jest includes a useful coverage feature.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Enzyme is a JavaScript testing utility created by Airbnb that makes it easy to
                        assert, manipulate and traverse your React components outputs thanks to its great API.

                        In other words, Jest and Enzyme are your best allies when you need to test a React application;
                        so, let’s take a look at the power of Jest and Enzyme with an example.

                        First of all, we need to create our React component to test it. Let’s create a simple component
                        called “MyFirstComponent” (it’s a good practice to capitalize the first letter of the class)
                        which will render a title and a button. The component will have a prop to set the title text and
                        a state to control the button behavior. The title’s prop will be set as “Hello World” by
                        default, and the state button will be set as “enable” by default. So you can click the button
                        and once you press it, it will become disabled.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">Progressive web applications (PWAs) are a type of mobile app delivered through
                        the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. They are
                        intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser. Functionality includes
                        working offline, push notifications, and device hardware access, enabling creating user
                        experiences similar to native applications on mobile devices. Since they are a type of webpage
                        or website known as a web application, there is no requirement for developers or users to
                        install the web apps via digital distribution systems like Apple App Store or Google Play.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        While web applications have been available for mobile devices for as long as mobile devices have
                        existed, they had generally lagged behind native apps in terms of speed, features, and user
                        adoption, especially on mobile devices. Direct access to hardware and the ability to work
                        offline, previously only available to native apps, allows PWAs to perform much faster and to
                        provide more features in line with native apps.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        PWAs do not require separate bundling or distribution. Publication of a progressive web app is
                        as it would be for any other web page. PWAs work in any browser, but "app-like" features such as
                        being independent of connectivity, install to home screen and push messaging depend on browser
                        support. As of April 2018, those features are supported to varying degrees by the Microsoft
                        Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari browsers, but more browsers may support
                        the features needed in the future.

                    <p class="paragraph">TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by
                        Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to
                        the language.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript.[5]
                        As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid
                        TypeScript programs. TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both
                        client-side and server-side (Node.js) execution.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph"> There are multiple options available for transcompilation. Either the default
                        TypeScript Checker
                        can be used,[6] or the Babel compiler can be invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript.[7]</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        TypeScript supports definition files that can contain type information of existing JavaScript
                        libraries, much like C++ header files can describe the structure of existing object files. This
                        enables other programs to use the values defined in the files as if they were statically typed
                        TypeScript entities. There are third-party header files for popular libraries such as jQuery,
                        MongoDB, and D3.js. TypeScript headers for the Node.js basic modules are also available,
                        allowing development of Node.js programs within TypeScript.[8]</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">

                        The TypeScript compiler is itself written in TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript. It is
                        licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        TypeScript is included as a first-class programming language in Microsoft Visual Studio 2013
                        Update 2 and later, beside C# and other Microsoft languages.[9] An official extension allows
                        Visual Studio 2012 to support TypeScript as well.[10]</p>

                        Applications that have the ability to render both on the server and on the client are called

                    <p class="paragraph">A mobile app or mobile application is a computer program or software
                        application designed to run on a mobile device such as a phone/tablet or watch. Apps were
                        originally intended for productivity assistance such as Email, calendar, and contact databases,
                        but the public demand for apps caused rapid expansion into other areas such as mobile games,
                        factory automation, GPS and location-based services, order-tracking, and ticket purchases, so
                        that there are now millions of apps available. Apps are generally downloaded from application
                        distribution platforms which are operated by the owner of the mobile operating system, such as
                        the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store. Some apps are free, and others have a price, with the
                        profit being split between the application's creator and the distribution platform. Mobile
                        applications often stand in contrast to desktop applications which are designed to run on
                        desktop computers, and web applications which run in mobile web browsers rather than directly on
                        the mobile device.</p>

                        In 2009, technology columnist David Pogue said that newer smartphones could be nicknamed "app
                        phones" to distinguish them from earlier less-sophisticated smartphones.[1] The term "app",
                        short for "software application", has since become very popular; in 2010, it was listed as "Word

                    <p class="paragraph">WebAssembly (often shortened to Wasm) is a set of standards that define a
                        portable (modular) binary format and a corresponding language similar to the assembler language
                        (Assembly) for executable program and environment-specific program interfaces into which it may
                        be embedded and interact with.[1][2] It was initially developed to improve performance of the
                        JavaScript applications and to be used inside Web browsers, but it is not constrained to them
                        only and can be embedded anywhere else.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Wasm does not replace JavaScript. It utilizes the Emscripten compiler to
                        compile C++ (or another input language) source code into a binary file which runs in the same
                        sandbox as regular JavaScript code, though as of 2019 it still does not have full DOM access.
                        Emscripten provides bindings for several commonly used environment interfaces like WebGL.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) maintains the standard with contributions
                        from Mozilla, Microsoft, Google, and Apple.</p>

                                (func (export "doubleExp") (param $0 f64) (result f64)

                                    )
